# genalg-llm-extractive-summarization
This is a project that I worked on implementing extractive summarization using a genetic algorithm a la https://aclanthology.org/P10-1095, but with an LLM twist.

Currently it takes data from the NewsRoom (https://lil.nlp.cornell.edu/newsroom/download/index.html) dataset and preprocesses it using pretrained BERT embeddings.
